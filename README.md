# Santander Monthly Account Report

This is a front-end web app for Santander account holders. A user should download a text file of their statement over a monthly period. They can then use this app to retrieve a summary of their transactions. I have included a MockStatementFile.js for a user to test the app.

## Get Started

```sh
git clone && cd Santander-account-report
npm install
npm start
```

You can now go ahead and upload your text file to view the results.

## Testing and code quality

To run tests:
```sh
npm test
```

## Tech used
- React

## Example Output

See the mockup.png file for an example of the display
